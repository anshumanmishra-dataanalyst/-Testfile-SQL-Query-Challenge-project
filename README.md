## SQL Queries

The following queries are divided into three levels of difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.

### Easy Queries (Q1 - Q10)

1. **Retrieve all student records from the dataset.**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Testfile;
2. **List all distinct values in the gender column.**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT gender FROM Testfile;
