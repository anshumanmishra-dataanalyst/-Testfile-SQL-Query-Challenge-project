## Project Overview

**Title:** Student Performance Analysis  
**Objective:** Analyze student performance data to identify academic trends and pinpoint areas for improvement.  
**Compiler:** MySQL

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams) from Kaggle. It contains detailed information about studentsâ€™ demographics, academic performance, and other related factors.

## Table Schema

The project uses a table named `Testfile` with the following columns:

| Column Name               | Data Type |
| ------------------------- | --------- |
| `gender`                  | text      |
| `NationalITy`             | text      |
| `PlaceofBirth`            | text      |
| `StageID`                 | text      |
| `GradeID`                 | text      |
| `SectionID`               | text      |
| `Topic`                   | text      |
| `Semester`                | text      |
| `raisedhands`             | numeric   |
| `VisITedResources`        | numeric   |
| `AnnouncementsView`       | numeric   |
| `Discussion`              | numeric   |
| `ParentAnsweringSurvey`   | text      |
| `ParentschoolSatisfaction`| text      |
| `StudentAbsenceDays`      | text      |
| `Class`                   | text      |

## SQL Queries

The following queries are divided into three levels of difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.

### Easy Queries (Q1 - Q10)
### Easy Queries (Q1 - Q10)
1. **Retrieve all student records from the dataset.**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Testfile;
2. **List all distinct values in the gender column.**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT gender FROM Testfile;
3. **Count the total number of rows in the table.**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM Testfile;
4. **Count the number of students for each gender.**
   ```sql
   SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS count FROM Testfile GROUP BY gender;
5. **Calculate the average number of raisedhands.**
   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(raisedhands) AS avg_raisedhands FROM Testfile;
6. **Retrieve all rows where raisedhands is greater than 50.**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Testfile WHERE raisedhands > 50;
7. **Show only gender, NationalITy, and Class.**
   ```sql
   SELECT gender, NationalITy, Class FROM Testfile;
8. **List all rows ordered by raisedhands in descending order.**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Testfile ORDER BY raisedhands DESC;
9. **Find the maximum value in the VisITedResources column.**
   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(VisITedResources) AS max_resources FROM Testfile;
10.  **Count how many students are in each Class.**
   ```sql
   SELECT Class, COUNT(*) AS count FROM Testfile GROUP BY Class;

Q1: Retrieve all student records from the dataset.**  
   **A1:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Testfile;
